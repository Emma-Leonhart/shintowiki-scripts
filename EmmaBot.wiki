This is the operational bot account used for automated maintenance on shinto.miraheze.org.

Its purpose is to run repeatable cleanup and migration tasks with transparent logging, persistent state files, and auditable edit summaries tied to GitHub Actions workflow runs.

Repository: https://github.com/Emma-Leonhart/shintowiki-scripts

== Operations policy ==

I, Emma Leonhart, am committed to CI-first bot operations. I do not run normal mass-edit jobs from my local computer anymore. Routine and major automated edits are implemented by changing the GitHub repository and executed through GitHub Actions. Local manual script runs are reserved for emergency intervention only.

== Immediate / in progress ==
