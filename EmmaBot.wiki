This is the operational bot account used for automated maintenance on shinto.miraheze.org.

Its purpose is to run repeatable cleanup and migration tasks with transparent logging, persistent state files, and auditable edit summaries tied to GitHub Actions workflow runs.

Repository: https://github.com/Emma-Leonhart/shintowiki-scripts

== Immediate / in progress ==

* '''Crud category cleanup''' - <code>remove_crud_categories.py</code> running (2026-02-25); stripping <nowiki>[[Category:X]]</nowiki> tags from all member pages across 112 subcategories of Category:Crud_categories. Now runs in GitHub Actions with <code>--max-edits</code> cap and is expected to take several days of automated runs.
* '''Talk page migration''' - <code>migrate_talk_pages.py --apply</code> running (2026-02-25); rebuilds every talk page into a clean structure and imports discussion seeds from ja/en/simple Wikipedia via QID sitelinks. State file: <code>shinto_miraheze/migrate_talk_pages.state</code>. Log: <code>shinto_miraheze/migrate_talk_pages.log</code>. Now runs in GitHub Actions with <code>--max-edits</code> cap and is expected to take several days of automated runs.
* '''Template:Talk page header''' - Edit this template so that it fits all requirements for migrated/transformed talk pages.
