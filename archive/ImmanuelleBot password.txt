Bot passwords allow access to a user account via the API without using the account's main login credentials. The user rights available when logged in with a bot password may be restricted.

If you don't know why you might want to do this, you should probably not do it. No one should ever ask you to generate one of these and give it to them.

The bot password for bot name "Bot" of user "ImmanuelleBot" was created.

The new password to log in with ImmanuelleBot@Bot is hljht8jdeh1p1562gke2tmj7hkqg9hkf. Please record this for future reference.
(For old bots which require the login name to be the same as the eventual username, you can also use ImmanuelleBot as username and Bot@hljht8jdeh1p1562gke2tmj7hkqg9hkf as password.)
